        <h2>The Tale of an IT student.</h2>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, a little wannabe IT girl was born in Wuustwezel, Belgium. Her name was Kathleen Puvrez. Well, actually, that’s my name. And the kid is me. <br>
            The first time I discovered IT was when I was just a toddler, playing Freddie Fish on our old Windows XP computer. I was around three years old when my brother and I would sneak to the pc in the hall at six in the morning. I grew up not minding games. I found them a fun waste of time, but I liked playing outside better. I kept dying and I needed my brother to play the game for me. I always enjoyed watching him play, because then I saw way more of the game than I would have on my own. My interest in games wasn’t that big until a few years ago.
        </p>


        <p>
            My interest in IT only came to me in 2014. I started delving into the depths of the internet, mostly YouTube. I heard a lot of people talk about different computer-related stuff, and I remember thinking: “I really want to know what they’re talking about. I want to understand everything.” Come to think of it, the last time I heard someone talk about the inside of a pc, I knew every single thing they were talking about. I actually made my own videos, filmed and edited them. I learned a lot back then, but decided to look into IT studies to do at school, because at school I learn more easily than at home. And I did, I learned more than I could have on my own. I learned what hardware is found inside the computer, I learned how to manage them via software. I learned how to play games, which is almost a must. <br>
            The picture is me doing obviously fake computer work because my mom didn’t want me to open up my case to do some obviously fake hardware work. We don’t have lots of photos of me on a pc, because my parents don’t find it interesting enough. I didn’t grow up in a family that thought computers are important. My stepfather doesn’t even touch those things.

        <p>
            The future is bright for “computer scientists”, as they call it. Everything these days involves IT. There’s a big niche for people who are experienced in that. Or at least, that’s what I have been told. Although I don’t know if I’m going to have a job in IT for my whole life, I think it’s a great start to my professional life. I would love to be a system administrator rather than a programmer though. I like to physically feel what I’ve made. I would consider helping make a game though. It would be like a dream come true.
